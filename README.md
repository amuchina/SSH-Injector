# ♠ SSH-Injector - OpenSSH Server injector for Windows with RPi pico
## By amuchina (Giovanni Desio)

## Description

This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico to create a BAD USB device (similar to Rubber-Ducky) capable of executing a keystroke injection attack on a target computer using a 
payload written in duckyscript 1.0. The ultimate goal is to open an admin PowerShell window 
and install an OpenSSH server on the victim's computer.

## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi Pico or Pi Pico W
- Host computer with Raspberry Pi Pico support and possibly Wireshark (Linux, macOS, or Windows)
- USB-Micro USB cable (I built an all-inside case for making it look like a normal USB hihihi)
- Text editor to modify the source code (notepad is enough for dd scripts)
- Basic knowledge of what you're doing

## How does it work?

The Raspberry Pi Pico used here is modified to be recognized as a HID (Human Interface Device) device when plugged in the victim's PC, emulating a key-injecting keyboard.
The recognition of the Pico (that will be later recognized as CIRCUITPY, due to the installation of circuitpython in the board) is modified through a file 
dragged into the root of the board that you can find at this link: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest. 
After that, thanks to the public repo of dbisu about turning a Pico into a bad-usb (https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky) I easily set up a
payload written in duckyscript (only version 1.0 is supported) executed at the usb plugging. This payload injects a series of keyboard commands 
in order to open an administrator Windows Powershell and type a command that will install the OpenSSH server 0.1.0 optional feature on the victim's PC within few seconds.
Then, the payload makes the machine do a ping to my local IP address (that can be modified in the payload basing on your needs) that I will track with Wireshark to find the IP source
of the ping, so I can connect to the machine. The payload is still in development, so I will add some improving features in order to exploit some stupid vulnerability and
do the operations smarter, so be gentle.

## Why is the functioning so stupid?

As you can see, the payload and prerequisities of this are quite foolish though. Why this? well, the functioning exploit some actions that you can easily do as
a normal user, but the point is that you should consider that most people nowadays are so silly to not protect their PCs from such stupid attacks like mine, that simply
use the ignorancy of people about the danger of plugging weird things in their machines just to see what's inside, or maybe the distraction of a moment.
Finally, most Windows user leave their Windows security options as default, allowing exploitable vulnerabilities such as the UAC password bypass.
By the way, this won't work on PCs that require an administrator password in the confirmation prompt in order to open admin processes and it's also bypassable keeping
open a notepad window! (which will receive the injected commands instead of typing them in the cmd) but most people don't know this because they are too lazy to
change a couple of options in the settings ;)
**Note: Despite this, I will configure the payload to bypass the admin pass in the future**

## Usage

Once the Raspberry Pi Pico is modified as a pico-ducky (follow the guide here: https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky) and programmed with the provided source code, just plug the device 
into the target computer and wait about 5 seconds. The source code will automatically perform the following operations:

- Keyboard simulation: Keyboard commands will be sent to open an admin PowerShell window.
- Execution of PowerShell commands: PowerShell commands are executed to install an SSH server on the target computer.
- Pinging the attacker IP: The Powershell will execute a ping to my local IP address

## Warnings

- Just use this for jokes or whatever is done to your friends or experimental devices
- This project is provided for educational and informational purposes only. I TAKE NO RESPONSABILITY FOR MISUSE OF THE SOURCE CODE FOR MALICIOUS SCOPES.
